# `cleveref-forward` â€” Forward-referencing functionality for cleveref

`cleveref-forward` aims at providing the forward-referencing functionality to `cleveref`.

This package is derived from the package [`cleveref-usedon`](https://ctan.org/pkg/cleveref-usedon), with several fixes and enhancements.

## Regarding the usage

It might be a good idea to start with the [demo documents](https://github.com/Jinwen-XU/cleveref-forward/tree/main/demo).

> The documentation and examples written by Sven Pistre for the original package [`cleveref-usedon`](https://ctan.org/pkg/cleveref-usedon) are also very inspiring (but be aware that the usage has changed a lot, so some of the code there may no longer work here).

## Known issues / what to do next

- The multilingual support is not yet perfect.
- The code is somewhat messy for now, and the naming of many macros should be made better.
- The support for displayed maths is still not perfect.
- Not all configuration yields nice result, more examples are needed.

The original package [`cleveref-usedon`](https://ctan.org/pkg/cleveref-usedon) is better in terms of documentation, while the current package is slightly more advanced in terms of code. It is hoped that one day they can be combined into a better version.


## Acknowledgement
